# The plot shows the number of touches in the final third each player has had.

# The raw data per match is shown by the small circle series.

# Each data set has a thick line drawn through the mean value.

# The thin line surrounding the raw data is the density of each set capped off at the standard boxplot whisker limit.
# This is Quantile25% - 1.5 * IQR and Quantile75% + 1.5* IQR.
